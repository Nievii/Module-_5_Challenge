The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.
I will use Matplotlib tables and figures which can be used for technical report of the clinical study. I have also provided a summary on the results

There are 249 mice in the combined data, that have been linked with SCC and have been given different drug regimens, in which they can be compared to the performance of Pymaceuticals’ drug of interest, Capomulin. 

Around 51% of the data set is male, and is 49% female. Within the Summary statistics it can be seen that Capomulin and Ramicane appear to be more effective than others based on lower mean, median, variance, standard deviation, and SEM values. However, it's essential to perform statistical tests and consider other factors to try and reach a more conclusive conclusion about the efficiency of these drug regimens. The box plot distribution further supports this, as the final tumor volume is the lowest for both capomulin and ramicane. 

From the Line plot it can be seen that it takes roughly 20 time point days until the tumor volume (mm3) starts to reduce with the drug regimen of Capomulin. Also, as the weight of the mouse increases the average tumor volume (mm3) also increases which can be seen in the regression model with a general positive correlation.
